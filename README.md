Cloudillo – Collaborating Infrastructure Owned by it's Users
============================================================

Why (the problem)
-----------------

Online collaboration has two main approaches:

* **Cloud based services:** Convenient but concerns about privacy, biases, ads, and censorship.
* **Self-hosted applications:** Flexible but challenging to set up and don't integrate well with each other.

What (the solution)
-------------------

Introducing Cloudillo, the Distributed, Self-Hosted, Open-Source Collaboration Operating System.

Unleash your creativity, collaborate effortlessly, and share without obstacles.

How (the architecture)
----------------------

Cloudillo goes back to the web's roots, offering basic building blocks for
content creation, sharing, and collaboration:

* **Global User Identity, Authentication, Profiles**
* **Generic Storage APIs for:**
  * Collaborative content editing (shared collaborative data types for any document type)
  * Finished content (file store for pictures, PDFs, videos, etc.)
  * Structured data management (databases, collected form data, etc.)
  * User actions (posts, shares, likes, follows, comments)
* **Access Control**
* **Simple, Secure Sharing Model**

Cloudillo is an open platform for building applications, combining the ease of
cloud-based services with the freedom of self-hosted open-source solutions.

It breaks vendor lock-in by separating identity and storage providers,
allowing easy migration between cloud providers or self-hosting.

Which (the services)
--------------------

Applications based on the Cloudillo platform can eventually replace:

* **Collaboration Services:** Google Docs, Office 365, etc.
* **File Sharing Services:** Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.
* **Social Media Services:** Facebook, Twitter, Mastodon, Nostr, etc.
* **Knowledge Management Services:** Notion, Obsidian, etc.
* **Communication Services:** Messenger, Skype, Google Meet, etc.
* ...
